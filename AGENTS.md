# Notes for coding agents

How code and documentation are laid out in this repository, so that
changes don't need reformatting after they are merged. They follow what
the history does; where it disagrees with a tool's or an agent's own
defaults, these win.

## Prose: hard-wrapped at about 76 columns

Markdown files (`README.md`, `CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/`) and comments
in Rust code (`//`, `///`, `//!`) are wrapped by hand. A line ends
before column 77 or so, counting indentation, and never goes past 80.

- Wrap what you write the same way. Don't write a paragraph as one long
  line, even if your own instructions say not to hard-wrap Markdown.
- When you add or change a sentence in a paragraph, rewrap the whole
  paragraph, so no line runs long and none is left short in the middle.
  Leave paragraphs you didn't touch as they are.
- Tables, code blocks, headings, URLs and other things that can't be
  broken stay on one line.

## Rust: rustfmt's default style for new code, no reformatting

There is no `rustfmt.toml`: code is formatted with rustfmt's defaults
(edition 2024, 100 columns). The tree as a whole isn't formatted, so:

- Format a new file with plain `rustfmt path/to/file.rs`.
- In an existing file, write the code you add or change in rustfmt's
  default style, and leave the lines around it as they are.
- Don't run `cargo fmt` over the crate or `rustfmt` over a file you
  only touched, and don't add a rustfmt configuration: either rewrites
  hundreds of lines nobody changed.
- Don't widen lines past 100 columns to match older code nearby that is
  wider.

Run `cargo clippy` on what you change and fix the warnings it gives for
your code.

## Behaviour: closer to the real machine beats unchanged results

A fix that makes the emulator behave more like the real hardware or the
real Windows is welcome even when it changes recorded results: the game
suite's golden hashes, test assertions that captured the old behaviour,
and save states or recorded input that no longer play out the same way.
Don't hold such a fix back, or bend it, to keep them as they were.

- Update what it changes in the same pull request: re-bless the goldens
  after looking at the new shots (see `docs/game-suite.md`), and change
  the assertions that encoded the old behaviour, saying in the commit
  what the real system does.
- Say in the pull request which recorded results changed and why the
  new ones are right.
- Reproducibility still has to hold. The determinism tests
  (`src/debug/determinism_tests.rs`) run one build twice with different
  host timing and compare the two runs; they don't compare against an
  older build. A fix that makes them fail has made the emulator depend
  on the host's timing, and that is a bug in the fix.
