## Introduction

Rust-DOS is a quick and dirty DOS emulator. It is not at all complete and most programs don't run yet. It does however contain a good amount of CPU mnemonics and interrupts implemented, and can run simple programs.

## Why

I wanted to learn more about the nuances of DOS emulation. Also, there's only one other DOS emulator written in Rust, and that one hasn't seen any development in 5 years and was using lots of unsafe{} code blocks.
